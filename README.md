# Negri-Prado-Control-Law

For application to Mass Concentration (MASCON) models for asteroids, and mission design, the control law developed by Rodolfo Batista Negri and Ant√¥nio F. B. A. Prado was utilized to estimate the required $\Delta V$ for stabilizing an escape trajectory. This has a wide range of application in space mission design, and can be adjusted to allow for various configurations.

# Controlling an Escape Trajectory:

This is an example of an otherwise esccape trajectory being stabilized. This ulilized a total of $\Delta V \approx 8.15897~m/s$ to stabalize the controlled trajectory for a total of 10 days:

# Configuration for a full asteroid scan:
This configuration utilized a total of $\Delta V \approx 7.55313~m/s$ over the course of 4 days, and lead to a trajectory that covered the asteroids surface. This can be utilized to create a detailed scan over an asteroid in a relativly short time span.
