# Negri-Prado-Control-Law

For application to Mass Concetration (MASCON) models for asteroids, and mission design, the control law developed by Rodolfo Batista Negri and Ant√¥nio F. B. A. Prado was utilized to estimate the required $\Delta V$ for stabalizing an escape trajectory. This has a wide range of application in space mission design, and can be adjusted to allow for various configurations.
